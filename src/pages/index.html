        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
        is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
        example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
        its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
      </p>

      <p class="intro__paragraph">
        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
        and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
        structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
        variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
        example:

      <ul class="intro__list">
        <li>
          Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
          to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
          client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
          HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
          and page navigation.
        </li>

        <li>
          Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
